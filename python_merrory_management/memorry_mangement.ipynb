    "Python manages memory automatically through a private heap and two primary reclamation strategies: reference counting and a generational garbage collector. \n",
    "Stack vs. Heap\n",
    "Python divides memory into two distinct regions to handle different types of data: \n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Memory: Stores temporary data related to function execution, including function call \n",
    "frames, local variables, and parameters. It follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order; memory \n",
    "is allocated when a function is called and immediately reclaimed when it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap Memory: A large, unorganized pool where all Python objects (lists, dicts, strings, etc.) \n",
    "are stored. Variables on the stack are merely \"names\" or pointers that reference the actual\n",
    " data living on the heap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reference Counting\n",
    "This is Python's primary \"first line of defense\" for memory management. \n",
    "How it works: Every object on the heap maintains a counter of how many active references point to it.\n",
    "Increment/Decrement: The count increases when you assign an object to a new variable or add it to a container (like a list); \n",
    "it decreases when a variable goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted with del.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate Cleanup: As soon as an object's reference count hits zero, Python immediately deallocates it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage Collection (GC)\n",
    "Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references (e.g., Object A points to Object B, and Object B points back to A), as their counts never reach zero. To solve this, Python uses a Generational Garbage Collector: \n",
    "Cycle Detection: It periodically scans objects to find and break these unreachable cycles.\n",
    "Three Generations: Objects are categorized into Generations 0, 1, and 2 based on their survival.\n",
    "Gen 0: Newly created objects; scanned most frequently.\n",
    "Gen 1 & 2: Objects that survive a collection cycle are \"promoted\" to an older generation, which is scanned less often.\n",
    "Manual Control: You can use the gc module to manually trigger collection via gc.collect() or adjust threshold settings. \n",
